          <p>Previously a paralegal, I began teaching myself to code in 2018. My first development job was for an art/education supply retailer in northern Indiana where I handled both their website and internal intranet. From there I moved into a software development role for a Managed Security Service Provider, where my tasks mainly involved the front end of the company's proprietary customer portal. I'm now employed as a software engineer at Traction Ag, a new tech startup in Auburn, Indiana, which will soon be offering accounting software designed specifically for crop growers. Stay tuned, as we are set to launch in late 2020! <a name="contact"></a></p>
